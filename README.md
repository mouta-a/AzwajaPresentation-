# Azwaja 
Cross-platform matchmaking / dating app to find the perfect partner for a long term relationship. Developed in Ionic framework with Typescript and Angular which makes it easy to build for several platforms and keep functionality for both iOS and Android. Ionic also comes with many pre-built components that makes it easier to build a good looking application. 

All the data for the app is stored on a cloud server, in a Firebase Database powered by Google. We made the choice to store it there because it's a cheap alternative for small companies and you can get pretty far with their free options. It was easy to learn how to set up the database there and we made good use of their security functions and built in methods for authorization.

The app is now in it's beta stage with a public release scheduled soon.
